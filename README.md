# Miss and Mist (more like hit and mist)
Names: Rainger (or niko or cid), Kayla, Shayaan

Description: Originally this was going to be something that sprayed you you if you missed, but murphy's law (as in everything has gone wrong :sob-hole:) kind of forced us to make a much simpler version of the project. It involves one Seeed Xiao RP2040 microcontroller along with a photoresistor in order to detect a laser, and when detected sprays water.

During the making, it was usually just bad luck (IR having multiple standards, etc.) that slowed us down but ultimately we got to make this as a scaled down version during our last day. It also required a lot of research into photoresistors and ways of transmitting data (lasers, IR, etc.)

Also, we spent a few hours CADing but unfortunately couldn't end up printing our stuff up bcs the print queue was too long :c
