# Miss and Mist (more like hit and mist)
Names: Niko (or rainger or cid), Kayla, Shayaan

Pretty much: you start a timer, you try to hit the target. You miss, and then you get hit with water. The project itself requires a photocell, DC motor, and a few other bits and pieces to get it up and running. We also used a laser pointer as a targeting solution for the player, you could technically use a really targeted flashlight as well but laser pointer recommended!

also make sure to have a good way to take off supports and a good printer, the pump will not print well otherwise! (as you will see if you watch the demo :pf:)

to run the code, install circutpython on your xiao! it may work on micropython but i can't guarentee, so please just use the latest version of circutpython for the xiao in order to run the code (code.py is the file to run!)
